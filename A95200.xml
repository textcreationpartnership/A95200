            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156117:3"/>that they intended to returne thither againe to take poſſeſſion of the place very ſodenly, all which my lord hearing gaue ſtrict charge to the Cheefe men of the Towne by no meanes to let them haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, which they did, for when the Prince came with his forces the Town ſtood vp in armes to reſiſt him in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim my lord of <hi>Stamford</hi> wheeld about him with his forces and ſo invirond him round, that the prince with moſt of his followers were faine to take water and ſwim over a great River for the ſafety of their liues, wherein the cavaleers ſuffered and were drownded, ſome my lord tooke priſners, whom hee ſent vnder a ſafe guard to be conducted to London where as yet they remaine.</p>
            <p>Thus hath the Parliaments party ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the day, and won the victory over the Welch Cavaleers, which I beleeve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Country men will take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by them, and learn how to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own bounds and liberties.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:156117:4"/>
            <p>Newes is brought over that <hi>Oneale,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Iriſh Rebels, had bribed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine poor Proteſtants to ſet on fire <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> the Metropolitane Towne of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that hee himſelfe went thither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, with ſome others to be aſſiſtants in the ſame, but his treachery was prevented and divulged by the ſaid Proteſtants, who at their examination confeſſed the ſame, which thing <hi>Oneal</hi> having intelligence of, privately haſtned to his fellow Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe joyfull Newes is brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the Rebels are brought to ſuch a ſtraight, that they muſt very ſhortly yeeld or periſh, and they would come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon reaſonable conditions, of which theſe are the chiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That every man ſhould have that freedome and ſcope, as to be of that Religion, as beſt agrees to his owne particular conſcience (alledging that King</hi> James <hi>did allow of the ſame, and that our King</hi> Charles <hi>did not gaine ſay it.)</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:156117:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that the Parliament here in England ſhould not proceed over ſevere againſt their ancient Romane Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that they ſhould not be lyable to pay any taxation whatſoever, whether for their Religion, or any temporary accident, but onely what voluntarily they condeſcend unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, that certaine Lawes ſhould be eſtabliſhed and enacted according to their wills, and to be obeyed and kept by none but their Sexaries, namely that none ſhould be compelled to keep them but they themſelves, not excepting others that voluntarily would.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tis to be noted, that theſe Articles were not by the univerſall conſent of all the Rebels propounded, for many of them were more reſolutely bent to dye in the defence of their Faith; but by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them that were pend up in a nook by our men, ſo that they could hardly ſcape away.</p>
            <p>Much malicious and wicked tyranny doe the Rebels uſe towards many of our men whom they take priſoners, cutting
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156117:5"/>out the tongues of ſome, ſcaring the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of others, and moſt inhumanely ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling divers by dozens in halters; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it were not much amiſſe to give them <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> and uſe them with the like ſeverity here in <hi>England,</hi> ſince their malicious proceedings is ſuch againſt our Brethren in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain joyfull Newes is brought of my Lord of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Encounter with 2. French ſhips, who after a long chaſe he took pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and received from them great ſtore of Ammunition, ſufficient for 300 men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſtore of field pieces, all which was thought was intended for His Majeſties aſſiſtance againſt the Honourable Houſes of Parliament. Likewiſe there were great ſtore of Muskets and Piſtols in the ſaid ſhips, being hid in falſe Cabines, which by a diligent ſearch were all found out and ſent by his Lordſhips command to <hi>Northampton</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
